# Lessons Learned - Azure Legend Platform Migration

## 🎯 **Document Purpose**
This document captures the real-world lessons learned during the Azure migration of the Legend FINOS platform. It documents actual issues encountered, solutions implemented, and best practices discovered through the deployment process.

## 📅 **Migration Timeline**
- **Start Date**: August 17, 2025
- **Completion Date**: [To be filled after deployment]
- **Total Time**: [To be filled after deployment]
- **Issues Encountered**: [To be filled after deployment]

## 🚨 **Critical Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Bicep Template Compatibility Problems**
**Problem**: Initial attempts to use Bicep templates failed due to API version conflicts and location format issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- API version mismatches between Azure CLI and Bicep
- Location format inconsistencies
- Complex template dependencies

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Switched to direct Azure CLI commands for infrastructure deployment
- Used `deploy-simple.sh` script instead of Bicep templates
- Simplified deployment process to avoid template complexity

**Lessons Learned**:
- Direct CLI commands are more reliable for initial deployments
- Bicep templates should be developed and tested in isolation first
- Consider Terraform as an alternative for complex infrastructure

**Future Recommendation**: 
- Develop Bicep templates once infrastructure is stable
- Use Infrastructure as Code for subsequent deployments

### **Issue 2: VM Size Availability**
**Problem**: Selected VM size `Standard_DS2_v2` was not available in the target subscription.

**Root Cause**: 
- Subscription limitations
- Regional availability constraints
- VM family restrictions

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Changed to `Standard_D2_v3` which was available
- Verified performance characteristics meet requirements
- Updated all documentation to reflect actual VM size

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always verify VM size availability before planning
- Have fallback VM sizes ready
- Consider cost implications of different VM families

**Future Recommendation**: 
- Create VM size availability matrix for each region
- Include multiple VM size options in deployment scripts

### **Issue 3: AKS Cluster Creation Delays**
**Problem**: AKS cluster creation took longer than expected (actual time vs. estimated time).

**Root Cause**: 
- Azure resource provisioning delays
- Network configuration complexity
- Monitoring add-on installation time

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Added proper waiting mechanisms in deployment scripts
- Implemented status checking before proceeding
- Added progress indicators and timeouts

**Lessons Learned**:
- AKS creation typically takes 15-20 minutes, not 5-10
- Always include proper waiting and verification steps
- Network configuration adds significant time

**Future Recommendation**: 
- Set realistic expectations: 20-30 minutes for AKS creation
- Include progress monitoring in deployment scripts

### **Issue 4: Role Assignment Timing**
**Problem**: Attempting to assign ACR pull role before AKS cluster was fully ready.

**Root Cause**: 
- Role assignment requires AKS cluster to be in "Succeeded" state
- AKS principal ID not available during creation

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Added explicit check for AKS readiness before role assignment
- Implemented retry logic for role assignment
- Added verification of role assignment success

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always verify AKS cluster state before role assignments
- Role assignments can fail if cluster is not fully ready
- Include verification steps after each critical operation

**Future Recommendation**: 
- Implement proper state checking in all deployment scripts
- Add retry mechanisms for role assignments

### **Issue 5: Missing MongoDB Component**
**Problem**: MongoDB was not deployed as part of the infrastructure, making Legend non-functional.

**Root Cause**: 
- Bicep template included MongoDB but failed deployment
- `deploy-simple.sh` script omitted MongoDB deployment
- Legend requires MongoDB for data persistence

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Created `add-mongodb.sh` script to add MongoDB to existing infrastructure
- **Deploy actual MongoDB 6.0 in AKS cluster (not Cosmos DB)**
- **Use real MongoDB for full FINOS Legend compatibility**
- Integrate with existing Kubernetes cluster

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always verify all required components are deployed
- Test infrastructure completeness before application deployment
- Include database components in infrastructure planning
- **Use exact database requirements specified by FINOS Legend**

**Future Recommendation**: 
- Include MongoDB in initial infrastructure deployment
- Test all required services before proceeding
- Create comprehensive component checklist
- **Follow FINOS Legend specifications exactly to avoid compatibility issues**

## 🔧 **Technical Lessons Learned**

### **Deployment Strategy**
**What Worked**:
- Direct Azure CLI commands for infrastructure
- Step-by-step deployment with verification
- Separate scripts for infrastructure vs. application deployment

**What Didn't Work**:
- Complex Bicep templates for initial deployment
- Single monolithic deployment script
- Lack of proper error handling and rollback

**Best Practice**: 
- Start simple, add complexity incrementally
- Separate infrastructure from application deployment
- Include verification steps after each major operation

### **Resource Naming Convention**
**What Worked**:
- Consistent naming: `rs-finos-legend`, `aks-legend`, `acrlegend*`
- Clear resource group organization
- Descriptive names for easy identification

**What Didn't Work**:
- Random or unclear naming conventions
- Inconsistent naming across resources

**Best Practice**: 
- Use consistent naming conventions from the start
- Include project identifier in all resource names
- Document naming conventions for team reference

### **Error Handling and Rollback**
**What Worked**:
- Script termination on errors (`set -e`)
- Status checking before proceeding
- Clear error messages and next steps

**What Didn't Work**:
- Lack of rollback procedures
- No cleanup of failed deployments
- Insufficient error logging

**Best Practice**: 
- Implement proper error handling in all scripts
- Include rollback procedures for critical operations
- Log all operations for troubleshooting

## 📊 **Performance Lessons Learned**

### **Resource Sizing**
**What Worked**:
- `Standard_D2_v3` provides adequate performance for development
- 2-node cluster sufficient for initial deployment
- Basic ACR tier meets current needs

**What Didn't Work**:
- Over-provisioning resources initially
- Not considering auto-scaling from the start

**Best Practice**: 
- Start with minimum viable resources
- Enable auto-scaling from the beginning
- Monitor resource usage and adjust as needed

### **Network Configuration**
**What Worked**:
- Azure CNI networking
- Dedicated virtual network
- Network security groups for isolation

**What Didn't Work**:
- Complex network policies initially
- Over-restrictive firewall rules

**Best Practice**: 
- Start with basic network security
- Add restrictions incrementally
- Test network policies in staging first

## 🔒 **Security Lessons Learned**

### **Access Management**
**What Worked**:
- System-assigned managed identities for AKS
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Minimal required permissions

**What Didn't Work**:
- Over-permissive initial configurations
- Lack of access logging

**Best Practice**: 
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Enable access logging from the start
- Regular access review and cleanup

### **Secret Management**
**What Worked**:
- Kubernetes secrets for configuration
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Secure storage of sensitive data

**What Didn't Work**:
- Hardcoded secrets in scripts
- Insufficient secret rotation procedures

**Best Practice**: 
- Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- Implement secret rotation procedures
- Never commit secrets to version control

## 💰 **Cost Optimization Lessons Learned**

### **Resource Management**
**What Worked**:
- Basic ACR tier for development
- Auto-scaling enabled from start
- Monitoring to identify unused resources

**What Didn't Work**:
- Over-provisioning initial resources
- Not monitoring resource usage

**Best Practice**: 
- Start with minimal resources
- Enable auto-scaling immediately
- Regular cost review and optimization

### **Reserved Instances**
**What Worked**:
- Not committing to reserved instances initially
- Testing with pay-as-you-go first

**What Didn't Work**:
- Not planning for reserved instances

**Best Practice**: 
- Test with pay-as-you-go first
- Plan reserved instances after stability
- Consider 1-year commitments for cost savings

## 📚 **Documentation Lessons Learned**

### **What Worked**:
