# Deployment Test Report

## Test Date
August 20, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Java Options Configuration Error
**Issue:** `common.env` had unquoted Java options causing shell execution errors
```bash
JAVA_OPTS_COMMON=-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
```

**Fix Applied:** Added quotes around the Java options
```bash
JAVA_OPTS_COMMON="-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200"
```

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Function Definition Order Issue
**Issue:** Multiple scripts called `print_status` before it was defined, causing "command not found" errors

**Affected Files:**
- `deploy-all.sh`
- `legend-engine/deploy.sh`

**Fix Applied:** Moved function definitions before their usage in all affected scripts

### 3. ⚠️ EXISTING: Configuration Duplication
**Issue:** Significant duplication between `common.env` and Azure-specific configuration files

**Impact:** Maintenance burden and potential for configuration drift

**Recommended Fix:** Complete the refactoring to use hierarchical configuration:
```
base.env → environment-specific.env → secrets.env
```

### 4. ⚠️ EXISTING: Inconsistent Secrets Loading
**Issue:** Scripts load secrets from different relative paths:
- `deploy-all.sh`: `../secrets.env`
- `legend-engine/deploy.sh`: `../../secrets.env`

**Impact:** Confusion about where to place secrets file

**Recommended Fix:** Standardize to load from project root

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Tests
1. **deploy-all.sh status** - Works correctly, shows current Kubernetes deployment status
2. **legend-engine/deploy.sh** - Script loads without errors after fixes
3. **local/start.sh** - Prerequisites check works (though some ports are in use)

### ⚠️ Partial Issues
1. **Port conflicts** - Ports 6100, 6300, 27017 already in use (expected if services are running)
2. **Local script limitations** - `start.sh` doesn't support 'status' command (by design)

## Current Deployment Status
```
✅ Legend Engine: Running (1/1 pods)
✅ MongoDB: Running (1/1 pods)
✅ Legend Studio: Running (1/1 pods)
❌ Legend SDLC: Not running (0/0 pods)
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Fix Java options quotes - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ Fix function definition order - **COMPLETED**
3. Commit and push fixes to prevent regression

### Short-term Improvements
1. Complete configuration refactoring to eliminate duplication
2. Standardize secrets loading across all scripts
3. Add validation for placeholder values before deployment
4. Create consistent error handling across all scripts

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement the common functions library fully
2. Add comprehensive configuration validation
3. Create automated tests for deployment scripts
4. Add health check commands to all service scripts

## Script Fixes Summary

### Files Modified
1. `deploy/common.env` - Fixed Java options quotes
2. `deploy/deploy-all.sh` - Fixed function definition order
3. `deploy/legend-engine/deploy.sh` - Fixed function definition order

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Test main deployment script
./deploy-all.sh status

# Test service deployment
./legend-engine/deploy.sh status

# Test local deployment
cd local && ./start.sh

# Check configuration
grep JAVA_OPTS common.env
```

## Conclusion

The deployment scripts are now functional after fixing critical issues with:
- Java options configuration
- Function definition ordering

However, the configuration structure still needs refactoring to:
- Eliminate duplication
- Standardize secrets management
- Improve maintainability

The current deployment in Kubernetes is partially working with Legend Engine, Studio, and MongoDB running, but Legend SDLC is not deployed.
